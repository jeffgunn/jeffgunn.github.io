        <h3>Air Travel</h3>
	    <p>Elevate IME Shell's travel partner, will book airline tickets for you and your guest. Your program includes one-way, coach class, nonrefundable airline tickets from your home city to Franz Josef Strauss Munich Airport (MUC) in Munich, Germany and one-way, coach class, nonrefundable airline tickets from Budapest Rerenc Liszt International Airport (BUD).</p>
      <p>After we receive your <a href="#REG" target="_blank">Registration Form</a>, an air travel itinerary will be e-mailed to you. You must indicate your approval and e-mail your approval by the deadline shown on the itinerary before your reservations can be made. Seating requests will be forwarded to the airlines for assignment based on availability. We will do our best to accommodate your requests. </p>
            <p>Once you approve your itinerary, you will be issued an electronic ticket and itinerary via e-mail. Approximately two weeks before departure, you will receive a travel package with special luggage tags, information on your ports of call and a program agenda. You will also receive another e-mail confirming your air itinerary just before the trip.             </p>
            <h3>Travel Documents</h3>
            <p>Every guest must have a passport valid for&nbsp;at least six months&nbsp;past the end of your trip. If you do not have a passport or yours expires before November 8, 2018, you must obtain one or renew it before the trip; otherwise you will not be permitted to board the airplane. You must register using your names EXACTLY as they are shown on the government-issued passport (and visa if necessary) you and your guest will present at the airport. &nbsp;</p>
      <p>All airline and seating requests are subject to availability. Within 48 hours of submitting your Registration form, an air agent will email you a proposed air itinerary for your approval. As airline tickets are only held for 24 hours, you must approve the proposed itinerary via email, or otherwise respond to the air department, within that time frame&nbsp;in order to secure your schedule. Your air tickets cannot be booked without your written approval.  After your approval, you will receive an electronic airline ticket confirmation,<br>
              <br>
        <strong>Important information on fees: </strong></p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>Air bookings are      based on the lowest cost fares available. Deviations from program travel      dates or airline preference may incur additional air travel charges, which      will be your responsibility.</li>
              <li>If you want to      upgrade (based on availability), you are responsible for additional costs      associated with the upgrade, including a $50USD nonrefundable service fee per      ticket. Using mileage to upgrade is based on availability and subject to      service fees. Air upgrades should be requested in the &quot;Additional Air      Comments&quot; section of your Registration form. If you are considering      using mileage to upgrade, submit your Registration form as soon as      possible, as there are a limited number of upgradeable seats on each      flight. This fee applies regardless of availability of upgrades.</li>
              <li>After ticketing,      any voluntary changes you make to your itinerary will incur additional      charges at your expense. This includes corrections to the spelling or      presentation of your name on your airline ticket.</li>
            </ul>
If you are extending your trip before or after the cruise, please note your extension plans below.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like assistance in planning your extended vacation, please indicate below and a Shell Travel Headquarters Travel Expert will contact you.  There is a $100USD fee per person.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
For air travel questions, please contact&nbsp;<a href="javascript:void(0)">ShellTravelHQ@Teplis.com</a>&nbsp;or call 888-885-1273 or&nbsp;678-420-2562. Air agents are available Monday through Friday from 7:30 AM - 10:00 PM Eastern Time. You will be sent a proposed air itinerary upon submission of your enrollment form. Please note that you will be responsible for any airline change fees once you approve your air itinerary.&nbsp;
