    	  <h3>Q: Will my cell phone work in Bora Bora?</h3>
    	  <p><strong>A:</strong> We suggest you confirm availability and roaming charges with your cell phone provider before the trip. Your cell phone must have a minimum of tri-band service to work overseas. Confirm with your cell service provider that your phone and access service will work in the country/countries you plan to visit.</p>
          <h3>Q: What time zone will we be in?</h3>
          <p><strong>A:</strong> French Polynesia is in the GMT -11 time zone. When it&rsquo;s 12:00 noon in the islands, it&rsquo;s…</p>
          <blockquote>
            3:00 pm in Los Angeles (+3)<br>
              4:00 pm in Denver (+4)<br>
              5:00 pm in Chicago (+5)<br>
              6:00 pm in New York (+6)<br>
              11:00 pm in Great Britain (+11)
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Q: How can I access the Internet to get my e-mail?</h3>
          <p><strong>A:</strong>  The <em>Four Seasons Resort Bora Bora </em>offers complimentary Wi-Fi Internet access in your Bungalow Suite. </p>
			</div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
      <h3>Q: Will I be able to use my credit cards?</h3>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. Major credit cards are accepted in French Polynesia. We recommend you bring spending money in U.S. dollars and exchange it for the local currency for purchases in markets or with local vendors.</p>
      <p>When making credit card purchases abroad, you will be charged in local currency by the vendor. Your credit card company will convert the charges based on the exchange rate they implement and will charge a &ldquo;foreign transaction&rdquo; fee for doing so, which will appear on your credit card statement. Visa, MasterCard and American Express are usually best for traveling, as they are accepted in most places. </p>
      <h3>Q: Money Matters</h3>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> The unit of exchange is the Pacific French Franc (CFP, or XPF in financial markets) which is tied to the Euro. The initials CFP originally stood for &ldquo;Colonies Françaises du Pacifique&rdquo; (&ldquo;French Colonies of the Pacific&rdquo;) but now officially stand for &ldquo;Change Franc Pacifique&rdquo; (&ldquo;Pacific Franc Exchange&rdquo;). Notes are issued in denominations of CFP 500, CFP 1,000, CFP 5,000 and CFP10,000. Coins come in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 franc pieces. The following are the approximate exchange rates in selected currencies:</p>
      <blockquote>
        1 Canadian Dollar = CFP 74<br>
          1 Euro = CFP 120<br>
          1 U.S. Dollar = CFP 105
      </blockquote>
      <p>We suggest you change your currency into one of these before you arrive in French Polynesia. The airport bank is open for all international arrivals and departures. Hotels will change U.S. and Canadian dollars. The exchange rate is usually 2–5% less than at the banks. </p>
      <p><mark><strong>Credit Cards</strong></mark><br>
      American Express, Visa and MasterCard are accepted in larger shops and restaurants. Other major cards are accepted, but less commonly. Please do not assume that smaller restaurants or shops will accept credit cards. The Four Seasons accepts American Express, Visa, JCB and MasterCard.</p>
      <p><mark><strong>ATMs, Bancomat, Autobank</strong></mark><br>
        Automatic Bank Machines are scarce in Bora Bora and will not accept all bank cards. You should not rely on these machines to replenish your cash. If you find one, it will supply you with CFP only. You will not find these machines in the hotels.      </p>
      <h3>Q: Will I need an adaptor to use my hair dryer, razor and other electrical appliances at Four Seasons Resort Bora Bora?</h3>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> The electrical service in French Polynesia is 220-240 volts, 50/60 Hz. Plugs are the round two prong European type C/E.North and South American guests and anyone with 110 volt electronic equipment: Take a look at the power pack you use to charge your computer, camera, and mobile phone. Most power packs function on both the 110 and 220/240 volt system. On the back it will indicate the voltage the appliance can manage. If you see a range such as &ldquo;110~240&rdquo;, you do not need an electrical converter, but you will still need an adapter that enables your two or three prong plug to be used in European type outlets.  If you see simply &ldquo;110&rdquo; on the charger (as you may with hair dryers), you will need both an adapter and electrical converter. Both are sold at most luggage, hardware and electrical appliance stores. If purchasing a converter, note that there are different types. Some can convert up to 85 watts (electric shavers and curling irons) and some convert up to 1800 watts (hair dryers). These gadgets are not interchangeable and can destroy your appliance if the voltage of your appliance exceeds capacity. If you plan to buy a converter, we strongly suggest you first check the wattage capacity of your appliance. We also suggest that if you intend to purchase a converter, you do so before you leave home. Note: If you buy a hair dryer that converts from 110 to 220, be sure it&rsquo;s in the 220 position before turning it on in the islands.  Up until a couple of years ago, one adaptor was probably sufficient, but if you have to charge your mobile phone, plug in your computer, charge your tablet, charge your digital camera, etc., you may want to consider bringing two or more or one adaptor plus a mini power strip.</p>
