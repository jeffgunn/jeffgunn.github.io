      <h2>Private Island Paradise in the Heart of Polynesia</h2>

          <p>Congratulations on your outstanding accomplishments in 2018 and on being named &ldquo;The Best of the Best&rdquo; at Shell. You have earned a spot amongst the elite and Shell would like to recognize these accomplishments by an incredible trip to the most celebrated island in the Jewel of the South Seas. The name &ldquo;TAHITI&rdquo; likely evokes images of palm trees, white-sand beaches, and turquoise lagoons — which is totally accurate. But the postcard version of a place is never anywhere near the whole story. This year, we invite you and a guest to  your own private Island Paradise, Bora Bora.  </p>
          <p>Bora Bora may feel worlds away, but this South Seas splendor is well within reach. The inevitable love affair with this island begins right before you touch down. The view from the plane window is a moment you will not soon forget. Have your camera in hand as you begin your descent and prepare for the moment when iconic Mount Otemanu comes into view. From that point on, each experience will only continue to exceed even your highest expectations.</p>

    	<div class="col-xs-12">
    	  <p>Bora Bora&rsquo;s perfect white-sand beaches give way to blue waters where tropical-colored fish animate the coral gardens and giant manta rays glide leisurely past. This could easily be defined as the center of the romantic universe, where luxury resorts and spas dot the island with overwater bungalows, thatched-roof villas, and a fabled ambiance. Simply put, Bora Bora is one of the most beautiful islands in the world.</p>
          <p>The Island Of Tahiti&nbsp;is an unforgettable place featuring a circle of peaks along its outer perimeter — almost like a crown for the island jewel. Most Tahitians live near the shore. Its capital, Papeete, offers all the amenities you might expect in a city. There are vibrant markets and nightlife, fancy restaurants and great shopping. Visitors also enjoy the Tahitian cultured pearl shops, but really that is just scratching the surface of what Tahiti has to offer. The interior of the island is largely wild and remains untouched as it has for ages. The topography is ancient and unchanged. Go off the beaten path and you&rsquo;ll find massive waterfalls and deep valleys with rivers traversing the land.</p>

          <p>The Islands of Tahiti were among the last places on the planet to be settled by humans. No one really knows why early people migrated here or even where they originated from, but the first evidence of humans is dated about a thousand years later than anywhere else in the world. The islands were also among the last to be colonized by Europeans.</p>
        <p>The Islands of Tahiti are the birthplace of the&nbsp;<a href="http://tahiti-tourisme.com/discover/tahitihotelsresorts.asp" target="_blank">overwater bungalow</a>. The first were built on Raiatea at the Bali Hai Hotel in 1967, and soon after they appeared on nearby Moorea as well. Today, they&rsquo;re synonymous with luxury escapes and are found on most tropical islands.</p>
          <p>It&rsquo;s home to the world&rsquo;s most unique vineyard.  Yes, it&rsquo;s possible to establish a vineyard on a coral atoll. And The Islands of Tahiti are the only place in the world to have one. Check out&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vindetahiti.com/?lang=en" target="_blank">Vin de Tahiti</a>&nbsp;in Rangiroa for white wines and rosés produced in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

          <p>&ldquo;Tahiti&rdquo; is&nbsp;<em>way</em>&nbsp;more than just one island.	  </p>
          <p>The Islands of Tahiti cover a vast area in the South Pacific — about the same size as Western Europe, in fact — and encompass 118 islands and atolls across five different archipelagos. There is&nbsp;<em>so much</em>&nbsp;to explore.</p>
          <p>The fragrant white tiare flower is the symbol of The Islands of Tahiti and is worn by both men and women as a necklace, head ornament, or behind the ear. Which ear the flower is placed behind is determined by whether one is single or taken.</p>
          <p>The word &ldquo;tattoo&rdquo; originated here.  In&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tahiti-tourisme.com/discover/tahitihistory-culture.asp" target="_blank">Polynesian culture</a>, tattoos have long been considered signs of beauty, and in earlier times they were ceremoniously applied when an individual reached adolescence. Even today, about 60% of French Polynesians have a tattoo. The word originated here with the god of tattoo, Tohu, who legend has it passed down instructions for painting all the oceans&rsquo; fish in beautiful colors and patterns.      </p>
