            <h3>Travel Documents</h3>
      <p>To enter French Polynesia, every guest must travel with a passport that will be valid for&nbsp;<strong>at least six months</strong>&nbsp;from your scheduled date of departure. If you do not have a passport or yours expires before <strong>November 19, 2019</strong>, you must obtain one or renew it before the trip; otherwise you will not be permitted to board the airplane. You must register using your names EXACTLY as they are shown on the government-issued passport (and visa if necessary) you and your guest will present at the airport. You will clear customs upon arrival at Faa'a International Airport (PPT, French Polynesia's only international airport) in Papeete, you'll then board a 45-minute flight to Bora Bora.</p>
      <p>If you do not have a passport and are obtaining one for the first time, you must apply in person at a passport acceptance facility such as a post office, public library or municipal office. You will need two photographs of yourself, proof of U.S. citizenship and a valid form of photo identification such as a driver&rsquo;s license. It can take four to six weeks from the time you apply to receive a new passport. Expedited applications are typically processed in two to three weeks.<br>
        For instructions and a directory of passport acceptance facilities, go to <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov" target="_blank">www.travel.state.gov</a> and click on &ldquo;Passports.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>If you need to renew your passport, you may be able to do it by mail. Go to <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov" target="_blank">www.travel.state.gov</a> and click on &ldquo;Passports&rdquo; for instructions and downloadable forms.</p>
            <p>If your name change occurred within one year of the date your passport was issued, you can send a completed U.S. Passport Re-Application Form (available at www.travel.state.gov/passport or a passport acceptance facility), a certified copy of your marriage certificate or your name change court decree, two recent color photographs (2&rdquo;x 2&rdquo;) and your current valid passport to:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>National Passport Processing<br>
                P.O. Box 13290<br>
                Philadelphia, PA 19101-3290</p>
            </blockquote>
      <p>There is no fee for this service unless you require it be expedited. Please note: photocopies and notarized copies are not acceptable for passport purposes.</p>
      <p>If your name change occurred more than one year since your passport was issued, you must submit a renewal application and pay the applicable fees. Non-U.S. citizens must check with their local embassy or consulate to confirm or obtain documentation for travel to and from France, including visa requirements and U.S. reentry. &nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Valuables </h3>
            <p>Each bungalow suite is equipped with a built-in safe for storing valuables and important documents. We strongly recommend you leave valuables at home or in your safe when you leave your bungalow for activities or touring on your own.</p>
      <h3>Value Added Tax (VAT)</h3>
            <p>Visitors may apply for a refund of the VAT (Value Added Tax) on black pearls and other<strong></strong><br>
              expensive items. The minimum purchase in some stores is XPF 20,000 and others XPF25,000(about US$200-$250). At the time of purchase the store clerk should explain the details and give you the proper forms. To qualify, you must have a receipt from the shop with a description of the item(s), the price of the item(s), the amount of VAT charged, and your name. In some cases, the shop will actually discount the VAT when you buy the product. In this case, you will receive a self-mailing form, which must be mailed after you have checked in for your flight home. In either case, to get the refund, after you check in with the airline for your flight home, you must present the merchandise at the VAT Refund Office, which is located at Faa&rsquo;a Airport just past the Domestic Arrivals area on the right. You must visit this office before clearing security. At the desk, be prepared to show the receipt(s), the merchandise, and the completed VAT Refund Form. If you are required to mail a form, you will find a mail box just past the            </p>
            <h3>Climate </h3>
            <p>The weather will be beautiful. The daytime high in Bora Bora will be about 30Â°C (85Â°F) and the low will be about 22Â°C (72Â°F). The temperature drops only a few degrees or so in the evening. Rainfall for the month of May is 4 inches or 100 mm. Most of the rain comes in brief heavy showers. Humidity is about 75%.</p>
      <h3>Sunrise and Sunset</h3>
            <p>These are major events not to be missed. Dawn begins at about 6:00 a.m. and sunrise is around 6:20 a.m. Sunset is at approximately 5:40 p.m. in Bora Bora; twilight ends<br>
              around 6:00 p.m. Most dramatic times for taking those postcard photos are 30 minutes after sunrise and 30 minutes before and after sunset.            </p>
            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>We will have photographers on hand capturing everyone, but we wanted to offer some suggestions when you are capturing your own.Â  Cell phone photographers, please be careful around salt water. A splash over the bow of a boat and, of course, a slip into a pool or ocean and your photo chronicle comes to an end. We suggest you purchase a waterproof case that you can use in and around water. As a rule, the best photos and videos of scenery are taken during the early morning and late afternoon when the light is warm and &ldquo;flat&rdquo;. During the day you will encounter very bright natural lighting which will create shadows. Professional photographers will tell you to use the flash during the day when taking photos of people. If you take the photo within 7â10 feet, the flash will eliminate at least some of the shadows and the &ldquo;raccoon&rdquo;look. If your camera comes with a battery charger, see that the power pack can accept a 220/240 volt charge. You can have great fun with underwater cameras. Nikon, Pentax, Olympus, and Sony all make excellent underwater cameras.Â  GoPro also makes a camera you can use underwater.Â             </p>
            <h3>Packing Suggestions</h3>
            <p>French Polynesia is the most casual, relaxed place we have ever held Compass Club. Casual, comfortable, lightweight clothing is appropriate at all times of day and night. In keeping with the spirit of Polynesia the attire for Final Gala Dinner and Awards is &ldquo;Neat Casual&rdquo; â slacks or khaki style shorts, Polo and Tommy Bahama style shirts for men, and for women, summer dresses, stylish shorts or pants with tops, and sandals. The evening takes place on grass, so we suggest flat shoes. No cutoff shorts, jeans, tee shirts, or flip flops, please.</p>
      <p>Reef shoes are rubber shoes or sandals you wear while wading and swimming that protect your feet in case you step on something sharp such as a sea urchin, stonefish, or piece of coral. You should be able to buy something that will serve as a reef shoe in most major sporting goods shops. Rubber sandals are acceptable, but they must strap on to your feet so they will not fall off when you&rsquo;re swimming. For the best protection, the tips of your toes should be covered.Â  Inexpensive flip flop (thong) sandals are useless. Teva and Keen brand sandals are acceptable. Reef shoes may be purchased in French Polynesia, but we suggest you take care of this task at home. They&rsquo;re cheaper and you don&rsquo;t want to waste time looking for reef shoes in the islands when you could be enjoying some of the most beautiful scenery on earth. Just so there is no misunderstanding, reef shoes are not just a &ldquo;good idea&rdquo;; they are essential if you plan to walk in the lagoon or snorkel without swim fins. The unspoiled natural beaches are lovely, but &ldquo;natural&rdquo; also means that they remain the way nature left them â sea urchins, stonefish, and all. Stepping on any of these things will cause a great deal of pain and can cause serious infection.      </p>
      <p>Bora Bora offers some great snorkeling opportunities. If you don&rsquo;t have snorkel equipment, don&rsquo;t buy it. Snorkel equipment, including swim fins, is available free of charge at the hotels. If you are an avid snorkeler, you may want to bring your own mask and snorkel and borrow fins from the hotel. If you have never snorkeled but intend to do so, you will find that it is uncomfortable to wear glasses under your diving mask. Snorkel masks with corrective lenses are available for sale in many dive shops and sporting goods shops. You will not find corrective lens masks at the hotels, so if interested, you should purchase the mask before leaving. Contact lens wearers will have no problem wearing their lenses under the mask.</p>
            <p><strong>On your packing list should beâ¦</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>lightweight slacks and shorts</li>
              <li>casual dress or sundress</li>
              <li>three or four lightweight shirts or tee shirts</li>
              <li>a rain jacket (just in case)</li>
              <li>comfortable walking shoes</li>
              <li>reef shoes</li>
              <li>sandals</li>
              <li>swimsuits and a cover-up</li>
              <li>hat</li>
              <li>sunglasses</li>
              <li>camera and extra flash cards</li>
              <li>sunscreen</li>
              <li>insect repellent (The little foil packs are convenient.)            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are required to take prescription medicine, you should bring enough to last the entire trip.Â  Always pack medicine, passports and valuables in your carry-on bag. Never pack them in the suitcases you check with the airlines. To avoid any possible customs problems both at home and in French Polynesia, keep the medicine in the container you received at the pharmacy/chemist. If you wear glasses or contact lenses, bring along an extra bottle of saline solution.            </p>
      <h3>Health and Safety</h3>
            <p>Most people return from these beautiful islands healthier than when they left home. The combination of fresh clean air, warm sun, and a relaxing way of life tends to be very good for the body and soul.Â  Most health problems experienced by visitors are related to heat exhaustion, sunburn and dehydration. These problems can be avoided by using common sense â stay out of the midday sun, drink plenty of bottled water, and use a strong sunscreen and apply it frequently. There are gentle tropical breezes which are cooling, but remember, the rays of the sun are intense.</p>
      <p>Immunizations for visitors to French Polynesia are not required unless you are traveling from an area infected with Yellow Fever or Cholera. If in doubt, please contact your nearest French Embassy or French Polynesia Consulate.      </p>
      <p>Mosquitoes are around, but never ruin an evening. If the air is still, you may want to use insect repellent.Â  If you go for a walk in the woods on Bora Bora, bring insect repellent. Sand flies, called &lsquo;nonos&rsquo;, live in the sand and can be a nuisance at night if you are sitting on the beach. Again, insect repellent solves the problem.</p>
