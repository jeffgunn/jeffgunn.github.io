			<h3>Travel Documents</h3><p>
        Every guest must have a passport valid for&nbsp;<strong>at least six months</strong>&nbsp;past the end of your trip. If you do not have a passport or yours expires before November 8, 2018, you must obtain one or renew it before the trip; otherwise you will not be permitted to board the airplane. You must register using your names EXACTLY as they are shown on the government-issued passport (and visa if necessary) you and your guest will present at the airport. &nbsp; </p>
      <p>All airline and seating requests are subject to availability. Within 48 hours of submitting your Registration form, an air agent will email you a proposed air itinerary for your approval. As airline tickets are only held for 24 hours, you must approve the proposed itinerary via email, or otherwise respond to the air department, within that time frame &nbsp;in order to secure your schedule. Your air tickets cannot be booked without your written approval. <br>
        After your approval, you will receive an electronic airline ticket confirmation, <br>
  <strong><br>
    Important information on fees:</strong></p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Air bookings are based on the lowest cost fares available. Deviations from program travel dates or airline preference may      incur additional air travel charges, which will be your responsibility. </li>
		  <li>If you want to upgrade (based on availability),      you are responsible for additional costs associated with the upgrade. Using mileage to upgrade is based on      availability and subject to service fees. Air upgrades should be requested      in the &quot;Additional Air Comments&quot; section of your Registration      form. If you are considering using mileage to upgrade, submit your      Registration form as soon as possible, as there are a limited number of      upgradeable seats on each flight. This fee applies regardless of      availability of upgrades. </li>
        <li>After ticketing, any voluntary changes you make to      your itinerary will incur additional charges at your expense. This      includes corrections to the spelling or presentation of your name on your      airline ticket. </li>
      </ul>
			<p><mark>If you are extending your trip before or after the cruise, please note your extension plans below.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you would like assistance in planning your extended vacation, please indicate below and a Shell Travel Headquarters Travel Expert will contact you.</mark></p>

        <p>Every guest must have a passport valid for <strong>at least six months</strong> past the end of your trip. If you do not have a passport or yours expires before November 8, 2018, you must obtain one or renew it before the trip; otherwise you will not be permitted to board the airplane.</p>
      <p>If you do not have a passport and are obtaining one for the first time, you must apply in person at a passport acceptance facility such as a post office, public library or municipal office. You will need two photographs of yourself, proof of U.S. citizenship and a valid form of photo identification such as a driver&rsquo;s license. It can take four to six weeks from the time you apply to receive a new passport. Expedited applications are typically processed in two to three weeks.<br>
        For instructions and a directory of passport acceptance facilities, go to <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov" target="_blank">www.travel.state.gov</a> and click on &ldquo;Passports.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>If you need to renew your passport, you may be able to do it by mail. Go to <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov" target="_blank">www.travel.state.gov</a> and click on &ldquo;Passports&rdquo; for instructions and downloadable forms.</p>
			<p>If your name change occurred within one year of the date your passport was issued, you can send a completed U.S. Passport Re-Application Form (available at <a href="http://www.travel.state.gov/passport" target="_blank">www.travel.state.gov/passport</a> or a passport acceptance facility), a certified copy of your marriage certificate or your name change court decree, two recent color photographs (2&rdquo;x 2&rdquo;) and your current valid passport to:<br>
        National Passport Processing<br>
        P.O. Box 13290<br>
        Philadelphia, PA 19101-3290</p>
      <p>There is no fee for this service unless you require it be expedited. Please note: photocopies and notarized copies are not acceptable for passport purposes.<br>
        If your name change occurred more than one year since your passport was issued, you must submit a renewal application and pay the applicable fees.<br>
        Non-U.S. citizens must check with their local embassy or consulate to confirm or obtain documentation for travel to and from France, including visa requirements and U.S. reentry. &nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Valuables</h3>
      <p>Each stateroom on the ship is equipped with a built-in safe for storing valuables and important documents. We strongly recommend you leave valuables at home or in your safe when you leave the ship for shore excursions or touring on your own.</p>
      <h3>Value Added Tax (VAT)</h3>
      <p>In Europe, most prices include a value-added tax (VAT) as high as 25% so be sure to inquire about the process when you make a purchase. It is like a sales tax, except it is built into the price you pay instead of being added at the cash register.  As a tourist who lives outside the European Union (EU), you may be able to claim a VAT refund in these ways.<strong></strong></p>
      <ol start="1" type="1">
        <li>The most common way is to use the store's refund affiliate, which can be identified by a decal such   as, &quot;Tax Free Shopping&quot; or &quot;Premier Tax Free,&quot; in the      store window. This is the easiest and most reliable method. The store      gives you a tax-free shopping receipt to present to Customs when you leave      Europe. After presenting your receipt to the customs official, you will take      your stamped receipt to the refund service's airport desk or border kiosk      for an immediate refund or, drop them in a special box at the airport for      the refund service or mail them to the refund service's nearest office when      you get home. You can have refunds credited to your Visa, MasterCard or      other credit card in your own currency.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol start="2" type="1">
        <li>In rare instances, you may      get a refund directly from the shop where you make your purchase. Request      a VAT refund form, have it stamped by a Customs official when you leave      Europe and mail the stamped form back to the store. For smaller      transactions, the cost of cashing a foreign currency check may exceed the      amount of the refund. However, this method is worth considering for large      purchases or if the merchant will credit the refund to your credit card      account instead of mailing you a check. In the latter case, your credit card      company will automatically convert the refund to your local currency.</li>
      </ol>
