      <p>All airline and seating requests are subject to availability. Within 48 hours of submitting your Registration form, an air agent will email you a proposed air itinerary for your approval. As airline tickets are only held for 24 hours, you must approve the proposed itinerary via email, or otherwise respond to the air department, within that timeframe to secure your schedule. Your air tickets cannot be booked without your written approval.</p>
      <p>After your approval, you will receive an electronic airline ticket confirmation. &nbsp;If you are extending your stay at The Four Seasons and have requested additional room night(s), Shell Events Headquarters at Elevate IME will notify you when these nights are confirmed. &nbsp;Your air itinerary will be processed once this is confirmed.</p>
